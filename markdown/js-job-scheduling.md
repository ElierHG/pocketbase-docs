Extend with JavaScript - Jobs scheduling

If you have tasks that need to be performed periodically, you could setup crontab-like jobs with `cronAdd(name, expr, handler)`.

Each scheduled job runs in its own goroutine as part of the `serve` command process and must have:

  * name - identifier for the scheduled job; could be used to replace or remove an existing job
  * cron expression like `0 0 * * *` ( _supports numeric list, steps, ranges or macros _)
  * handler - the function that will be executed everytime when the job runs

Here is an example:

```javascript
/ prints "Hello!" every 2 minutes cronAdd("hello", "*/ / 2 * * * * ", () => { console.log("
Hello!") })
```

To remove a single registered cron job you can call `cronRemove(name)`.
